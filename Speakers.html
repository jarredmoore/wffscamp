          <div class="speaker-name">Larry Cohn </div>
          <div class="speaker-title"> Producer and Co Founder </div>
          <div class="speaker-bio">  Larry has a diverse background blending his business acumen with personal development strategies and mindset growth philosophies. He is a graduate of The Harvard Business School for Executive Education and Negotiation, Washington University in St. Louis, The University of Santa Monica for Spiritual Psychology and The Fire Walking Institute for Research and Education. He has been a small business owner since 1990 when he opened up his first restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. He eventually grew his restaurants to include the food service operations for both The Phoenix Art Museum and The Desert Botanical Gardens. His sales grew from under $100,000 per year to over $5,000,000 per year when he sold the business. His restaurants were featured in Money Magazine, USA Today and Food and Wine. 
            Currently Larry is the co-founder and partner in NexCore, a business development and management company specializing in working with entrepreneurs and small businesses.
            
            Larry has always believed in giving back to the community and  he was awarded one of 8 grants nationwide from The Ford Foundation for over $250,000. The grant was used to collaborate with local arts organizations to develop an arts integrated education to intersect with St. Louis City Public Schools. His hobbies include adventure travel and adventure trekking, including The Pilgrimage of The Camino de Santiago de Compostela in Spain and Machu Picchu in Peru. Larry wants to help people build their businesses and their finances but he also wants to help people nurture their dreams and put life in their heart. He is also the founder of the C.O.H.N. ( Creating, Overcoming, Healing and Navigating) Academy in conjunction with the Whitfield Foundation for Success located in Fox Park. Larry is a board member of The Gateway South Development, The 7th Grade Poetry Foundation and an Advisory Board Member of Lift for Life Gym.
